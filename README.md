### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working on my first coding demo project. I'm learning HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
I'm having a great time with this new adventure.
I use SoloLearn and am also a student in Code Louisville. Isn't that exciting?
I'm looking to collaborate on app development.
I'm looking for help with the basics. I'm completely new to all this.
Ask me about HTML, Spanish language or anything pharmacy related.
You can reach me by e-mail at TahitiCastillo@gmail.com
Fun facts: 1) I first studied HTML around 1994 as an undergrad student. I didn't pursue it any further than one semester, but probably should have.
2) I'm looking for a career change. I strongly dislike pharmacy and landed there when my sales position in health insurance was outsourced and the company sent me to the pharmacy side of the business.
3) No interesting story behind my name. Just "Tahiti" like the name of a country in French Polynesia.
4) I love world languages. I'm bilingual (Spanish) and also study French, Portuguese and Mandarin.
