### Greetings, üëã
My name is Tahiti, and this is my first official coding demo project. I'm developing my skills in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
I'm relishing this process, and excited about all that lies ahead. 
I'm working on building a personal website, and I also look to collaborate on app development. I have a couple of big ideas for apps. I just need to flesh out these ideas and develop the necessary skill set to bring these projects to fruition.
Once I've completed my first couple of demo projects, I'll be looking for help with the basics of app development. I'm relatively new to all of this. I'm open to learning all that I can to get my ideas up and running, and to also assist others once I have the necessary skill set. To be sure, I have approximately one year of HTML and CSS experience and am newly picking up Javascript and C++.
#### Ask me about: 
* basic HTML
* Spanish language
* English as a second laguage and language learning in general
* anything pharmacy related
* investing and personal finance
##### Fun facts: 
- I first studied HTML many years ago while an undergrad student. I didn't pursue it any further than one semester, but I'm grateful that the seed was planted, so to speak. 
-My overarching vocation is communication, which manifests as compulsion toward creative writing and foreign language learning & instruction. As with the discipline of communication, the facets of front-end development that most resonate with me are the ideation, process improvement and problem-solving aspects. 
- I'm looking for a career change. I landed in Pharmacy when my department (sales) was relocated, the company reorganized and I thence got transferred to a completely different section and role. Although I've learned a lot about pharmacy and the healthcare industry over the years, it is clearly not my calling. My education and employment background also includes Communication and Education. 
- I am passionate about world languages. I'm bilingual (self-taught Spanish) and also routinely study French, Portuguese and Mandarin. I dabble in Arabic, Russian and Hindi.
- There is no interesting backstory behind my name, although I get asked often. Just "Tahiti" like the name of a country/island in French Polynesia that I've yet to visit but that is somewhere around #10 on my bucket list of about 30 destinations. As an introvert, I'm something of an "island", so the name fits. Names should be meaningful; wouldn't you agree?
