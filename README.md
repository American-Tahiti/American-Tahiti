### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tahiti, and I'm currently working on my first coding demo project. I'm learning HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
I'm having a great time with this new adventure. I use SoloLearn and am also a student in Code Louisville. Isn't that exciting?
I'm looking to build a personal website and collaborate on app development. I have a couple of big ideas for apps. I just need to flesh out these ideas.
I'm looking for help with the basics. I'm completely new to all this.
#### Ask me about: 
*Basic HTML
*Spanish language
*English as a second laguage
*anything pharmacy related
*investing and personal finance
You can reach me by e-mail at TahitiCastillo@gmail.com
##### Fun facts: 
- I first studied HTML around 1994 as an undergrad student. I didn't pursue it any further than one semester, but probably should have.  
- I'm looking for a career change. I strongly dislike pharmacy; I landed there when my health insurance sales position was outsourced, hence I got transferred.
- No interesting backstory behind my name. Just "Tahiti" like the name of a random country/island in French Polynesia. It fits. As an introvert, I'm kind of an island.
- I love world languages. I'm bilingual (Spanish/English) and also study French, Portuguese and Mandarin. I dabble in Arabic, Russian and Hindi.
