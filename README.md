### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tahiti, and this is my first coding demo project. I'm learning HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
I'm thoroughly enjoying this new skill development. I use SoloLearn and am also a student in Code Louisville. Isn't that exciting?
I'm looking to build a personal website and collaborate on app development. I have a couple of big ideas for apps. I just need to flesh out these ideas and develop the necessary skill set to bring these ideas to fruition.
I'm looking for help with the basics of app development. I'm relatively new to all of this. To be sure, I have approximately one year of HTML and CSS experience and am newly picking up Javascript and C++.
#### Ask me about: 
* basic HTML
* Spanish language
* English as a second laguage and language learning in general
* anything pharmacy related
* investing and personal finance

##### Fun facts: 
- I first studied HTML many years ago while an undergrad student. I didn't pursue it any further than one semester, but the seed was planted, so to speak. As with my vocation of  communication, the aspects of front-end development that most resonate with me are the ideation, process improvement and problem-solving aspects. 
- I'm looking for a career change. I landed in Pharmacy when my health insurance sales position was outsourced, and I thence got transferred. Although I've learned a lot about pharmacy and the healthcare industry over the years, it is clearly not my calling. My education and employment background also includes Communication and Education. 
- I am passionate about world languages. I'm bilingual (self-taught Spanish) and also routinely study French, Portuguese and Mandarin. I dabble in Arabic, Russian and Hindi.
- There is no interesting backstory behind my name, although I get asked often. Just "Tahiti" like the name of a country/island in French Polynesia that I've yet to visit but that is around #10 on my bucket list. As an introvert, I'm something of an "island", so the name fits. Names should be meaningful.
